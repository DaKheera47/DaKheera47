# hey, i’m Shaheer Sarfaraz (DaKheera47) 👋

I’m a Computer Science student in the UK, and I like building things that remove friction.

Most of my work lives in the overlap between product engineering and automation: web apps that feel clean to use, systems that turn messy manual workflows into repeatable pipelines, and tooling that keeps data organised instead of scattered across tabs and docs.

## what i do
- Full-stack web development
- Automation + orchestration (scripts, workflows, integrations)
- Systems thinking: take a vague problem, break it into parts, ship an end-to-end solution
- Self-hosting + tooling: I like owning my stack when it makes sense

## how i work
I’m biased toward shipping. I care about clean interfaces, strong defaults, and making things easy to operate after they’re “done”. I’d rather build a boring system that runs every day than a flashy one-off that needs babysitting.

I also don’t like manual admin work, which is why a lot of my projects end up being “this annoyed me, so I built the tool I wish existed”.
