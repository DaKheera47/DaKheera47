# hey, i’m Shaheer Sarfaraz (DaKheera47) 👋

I’m a Computer Science student in the UK, and I like building things that remove friction. Most of my work lives in the overlap between product engineering and automation: web apps that feel clean to use, systems that turn messy manual workflows into repeatable pipelines, and tooling that keeps data organised instead of scattered across tabs and docs.

I mainly do full-stack development and I’m comfortable owning the whole lifecycle, from turning a vague problem into something concrete, to shipping an end-to-end solution that doesn’t need babysitting. I also spend a lot of time on automation and orchestration, whether that’s scripts, workflows, integrations, or stitching services together so the boring parts happen automatically.

I’m biased toward shipping, but I care about the boring details: clean interfaces, strong defaults, and making things easy to operate after they’re “done”. I’d rather build a system that quietly runs every day than a flashy one-off. A lot of my projects start the same way too: something annoys me, so I build the tool I wish existed.
